# Countdown-Timer-Program
This Python script, `countdown_timer.py`, is a simple countdown timer. The user inputs a time in seconds, and the script counts down to zero, displaying the remaining minutes and seconds in real time. Once the countdown reaches zero, it prints "Timer completed!"

## Key Features:
- Takes user input for the countdown time in seconds.
- Displays the countdown in the format `MM:SS`.
- Updates the countdown every second using `time.sleep()` and overwrites the previous output in the same line.
- Prints a completion message when the countdown reaches zero.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- `time` library for handling delays and time formatting.

## Usage Instructions:
1. Install Python 3.x on your system.
2. Run the script `countdown_timer.py`.
3. Enter the countdown time in seconds when prompted, and watch the countdown in real-time.
